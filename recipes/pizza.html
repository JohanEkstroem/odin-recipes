    <h3>Pizza</h3>
    <p>(Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is an Italian dish consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices bacon</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) container refrigerated pizza crust</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dry ranch seasoning, divided</li>
        <li>⅓ cup ranch dressing</li>
        <li>6 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>⅓ cup cubed, cooked chicken</li>
        <li>⅛ cup sliced red onion</li>
        <li>1 small tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a large skillet and over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels and cool.</li>
        <li>Pour oil into a 12-inch cast iron skillet. Brush oil all over the interior of the skillet. Place dough into the skillet and shape into a pizza, forming a crust at the edge. Prick dough all over with a fork.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Remove from oven and reshape dough if necessary. Sprinkle the top of the dough with 2 teaspoons ranch seasoning. Spread ranch dressing on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella, chicken, and red onion over pizza crust. Crumble cooled bacon on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and top is browned, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pizza from oven and top with tomato slices. Melt butter and mix in the remaining dry ranch seasoning. Brush crust with butter-ranch mixture.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Broil pizza until cheese is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, being careful not to burn.</li>
